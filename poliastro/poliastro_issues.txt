poliastro issues
- ephemeris function for 3rd body
	✅ unclear how orbital period parameter is used : what for sun with an earth-centered propagation
		✅ got an answer on github
	- errors even with properly formatted command
		✅ bug with short durations. Either increase duration (works indeed) or use fixed position workaround (meh) for short durations
		✅ testing if bug fixed in main branch --> yes but other bugs --> discussion ongoing on github

- eclipses
	- eclipse event only registers last crossing, not all of them
		✅ need to use the eclipse function
	- eclipse function not documented in poliastro, comes from a 1965 book impossible to find online, only in paper
		✅ got pictures of the book by a friend in germany whose university library has a paper copy
		✅ figured out implementation

- communication windows
	✅ no ECEF coordinates in poliastro to compute it directly with same code used for tudatpy
		✅ looking at conversions with other libraries --> convert to ITRS with astropy
	✅ ECI frame used in poliastro not well documented
		✅ comment by dev on a github issue says GCRS

- output
	- no keplerian parameters output
		✅ implemented rv2coe function with corrections to match usual format
