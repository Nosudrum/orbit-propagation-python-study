# Analysis

The analysis code simply finds all the results for a given set of input data and processes them to make plots.

All the plots are automatically saved using a naming convention containing the relevant input parameters.

## Installation

You can install the required packages in a new dedicated environment called *analysis* by navigating to this directory and running
the following command :

```
conda env create -f analysis.yaml
```
